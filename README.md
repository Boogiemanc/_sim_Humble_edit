# Ducktape Humble
- As the name suggest is the eufs_sim with minor script edit so it could run as intended on [RO2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html)
- all the required packages(ackermann_msgs,eufs_msgs,eufs_sim) are included in build


# Steps to launch the sim:
- Read the offcial wiki on how to [launch the sim](https://gitlab.com/eufs/eufs_sim/-/wikis/Getting-Started-Guide)
